# James's Personal Website

Honestly, it's a pretty boring website.  But, what it lacks in interesting content, it hopefully makes up in good development practices.  

It's intended to be *extremely* lightweight, and it __gets a perfect score (100%) on [Google's PageSpeed tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkurtz.es%2F)__ for both Desktop and Mobile.  

While a couple external libraries are used, they are used very sparingly, and only the portions which are absolutely necessary are included. 

Currently, CSS and JavaScript are inlined by server-side insertion at run-time.  At some point, the intent is to move this to a compile-time or deploy-time insertion, making the page more static.

Also, quite soon, I intend on moving this site to the CMS I've built on AWS, which currently handles most of the other websites I manage.
